# Mental-health-bot


The Mental Health Assist Bot is an AI-driven chatbot designed to offer mental health support and assistance to individuals experiencing emotional distress, depression, or stress. The bot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging the DialoGPT model, to generate dynamic, empathetic, and contextually appropriate responses based on users' input.

1.Chatbot Logic: We've implemented the core logic of the bot, which dynamically generates responses using the DialoGPT model. This ensures that the chatbot can engage in meaningful and responsive conversations with users, providing real-time emotional support.

2.Sentiment Analysis and NLP: We have integrated sentiment analysis capabilities to assess the emotional tone of the user's input. This allows the bot to tailor its responses based on the emotional context of the conversation, providing comforting, positive, and supportive feedback.

3.User Interface: We’ve designed a simple, user-friendly interface to allow users to easily interact with the bot. The goal is to make the chatbot accessible and easy to use for anyone seeking help.

4.CSV Dataset: The bot is being trained on a dataset that includes example conversations and appropriate responses. This dataset helps the bot learn how to respond effectively to various emotional situations.

5.Dynamic Responses: We’ve set up the system to generate dynamic, real-time responses rather than relying on predefined replies. This ensures that the chatbot's responses feel more natural and personalized to each user.
